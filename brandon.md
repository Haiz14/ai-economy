Even if AI gets really competent like some random person, Brandon (not that literate in debugging, or having the patience to think how a feature should be implemented) will ask AI "Make me a termux like app", and AI will ask for a certain amount of money (google play licence, AWS hardware) and it will published wherever u want.

Then there will come a time while using termux that Brandon will want more features, there will be some parts that are not working like you want, some customer reviews asking for certain features. And little by little the no of features/changes will increase. Either he will ask a developer (birth of a job/economy) to do the work after being frustrated of all that prompting and debugging of why ai is not doing what he wants it to do. Or he's passionate enough to complete it and gonna continue working on it.

3 months later, termux  was a really successful app on play store during launch, earned a million dollars, but after the third month of launch there's hundreds of free termux like apps in the market and each one is similar to every other app on the market. 

Now, Brandon is wondering how I can earn profits like that again? How can I continue to have an edge in a market, where anyone can add a feature on a whim? (can ai really add features on a whim?) 

he got the idea listen to what the customer asks in review, rather than adding all the features i wanna copy from others.

here's a little interaction between brandon and ai, with the gosl to lsiten to all reviews.

brandon "Look at all the reviews in google play store and all of tjem to the app"
ai "there are 300, 000 points of conflicts between the features, like some users want 'menue' (a typo i as an ai made) to be called 'menu', 'menutalista'  and some 'makuchirama'"

brandon "ignore errors related to typo like these"

ai "125, 000 points of conflicts remain, like some users want the first three options in settimgs to be 'sound, language, manchurian' and some 'sound, language , macros'"

and bramdon finally gave up for today. Then news came up, Googlo, seeing the popularity of termux finally released tagmux with 50 of its best employees working o. it. And brandon wnet to check it out mad compare it with his child.

He first saw, that the ui had something ant it. It looked really good and felt imtuitive to use, unlike his one where the options were just here amd there. Like a developer who had a deadline of 3 hours, and he hadd to place the ui elements in a rush.

Then there's the way features were implemented, they were really fast, 100 times faster than his passion project.

And finally the bombshell, it takes googlo $10,000 to keep the app scaled up to 10 milliom people, while it took brandon $900,000; 90% of his profits.

And bramdon wnet to sleep. Next day he checked his bank balance, $100K were remaining. And he hired the developer of his most compeptent knock-off (it was actually much better tham his ome, but sadly didn't gain popularity due to its horrendous ui). 

Brandon learnt what makes an app popular and that new developer knew how to create a proper app. Together they went to compete against googlo, and won the termux app war, 10 years later. 

3 years later, brandon died of a heart-attack due to stress.
